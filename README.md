### About the project
When I designed and developed this project I was going off a design image I found on dribbble, which is in the "design" folder. I didn't want to have the exact same pictures and color schemes as the design, just the general look. So I chose an image from unsplash and chose the colors base off the image, I used a free online software that helped me achieve this goal. I did some googling to find a way to get the icons inside the input field and for the overall look. (link mentioned above)
I design it with mobile first approach, that way it looks good on both ends. This is primary the reason why I went with this design instead of a too complex one as I would think it would harder to come up with a mobile approach. Something simple but still looking modern I believe was the best approach in my opinion.
